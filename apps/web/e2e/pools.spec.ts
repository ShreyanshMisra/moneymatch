/**
 * Phase-4 exit criterion + required e2e (07-phase-4):
 * a CS2 user picks Medium, sees bars quoted from their own baseline, enqueues,
 * lands in a formed room whose room_bar is the rounded mean of members' bars
 * (shown with the delta), plays a (fixture) FaceIt match, is graded from
 * server-fetched telemetry, and is paid their pool share — zero client input
 * after enqueue.
 *
 * Prerequisites (see e2e/README.md): a running stack (`make dev`) with a stubbed
 * FaceIt adapter that resolves each member's next match deterministically, and
 * the test-auth seam (`E2E_AUTH=1`) so four seeded, CS2-linked users sign in via
 * the API's `/dev/e2e/token` route.
