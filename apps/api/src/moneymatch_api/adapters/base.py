"""The GameAdapter interface plus the shared, host-agnostic value types.

Ported from `poc-reference/api/_lib/adapters/base.py` (11-migration-map §1), with
`TelemetrySample` moved here (05-phase-2 · deliverable 1). A normalized
`NormGame` is the lowest common denominator every adapter produces, so the
shared metric/settlement logic never sees host-specific JSON.

Phase 2 uses the identity/profile/history surface (`link_account`,
`fetch_profile`, `poll_eligible_games`). Match brokering and result grading are
Phase-3 concerns; the seams are declared here and implemented per-adapter as they
land, so nothing about the Phase-1 PoC `Contract` schema leaks into the port.
