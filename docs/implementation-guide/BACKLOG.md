# Backlog (post-MVP / discovered during build)

Items discovered mid-phase that are out of that phase's scope land here with a
one-line rationale. Seeded with known post-MVP work:

- **OAuth account binding** (Lichess OAuth, FaceIt OAuth2, Steam OpenID) —
  replaces username-claim; prerequisite for anything beyond internal beta
  (integrity audit #5, #6). Targeted Lichess challenges bound to both accounts.
- **Spectate/tracker panels** — port `poc-reference/api/_lib/spectate.py` /
  `tracker.py` + PoC hooks for a live match detail view in Activity.
- **Chess accuracy + Dota solo pools** — needs server-side analysis fetching /
  richer telemetry; engine already game-agnostic.
- **Single-elim bracket tournaments** — real scheduling machinery.
- **Email + push notifications** — `notifications.channel_sent` is ready.
- **Mobile layout pass** — the PDF is desktop-only.
- **Marketing/landing page + waitlist** — gtm-prelaunch.md §2.
- **Host cheat-flag ingestion + clawback** — gems-phase integrity item.
- **Smurf floors** (min account age / rated games / non-provisional rating)
  before public launch.
- **SSE for live surfaces** — replace polling where it hurts.

From the [production launch plan](../proposals/production-launch-plan-v3.md)
(adopted in spirit, deferred past MVP):

- **Payment-processor application timing** — start the processor application /
  underwriting conversation (Stripe restricted-business or a gaming PSP:
  Nuvei/Paysafe/Aeropay/Trustly) **as soon as the public entity + domain
  exist**; approval clocks run in months and require the counsel memo. The
  `PaymentProvider` seam (Phase 7) is the code-side hedge if Stripe declines.
- **Electron overlay rewire** — the launch plan §9 has a full plan (read-only
  device token via `safeStorage`, `GET /overlay/active?game=`, contest-shaped
  card, electron-builder distribution). Only after MVP, and only against the
  new API.
- **Directional value-flow monitoring** between account pairs (collusion/AML)
  — pairs with the Phase-5 pair caps; needed before real money.
- **Chargeback runbook + withdrawal holds** (48–72 h on fresh deposits) —
  real-money items; the ledger `receivable` account concept lands with them.
- **Z-scored tournament scoring** (`(score − μi)/σi` — performance relative to
  your own baseline) — the config escape hatch if raw-value ranking shows the
  top of the μ spread winning too often. Launch on raw value with a tight
  dispersion cap; decide with data.
- **Same-lobby CS2 friend duels** — friends who can join one FaceIt lobby get
  the cleaner same-match objective (no cross-lobby variance) as a fast-follow.
